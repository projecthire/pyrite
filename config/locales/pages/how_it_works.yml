          body_html: |
            <p>
              There are two types of write-up that a candidate can submit: a case
              study (the “PH Case”) or an original investment idea.
            </p>

            <h4>
              PH Case
            </h4>

            <p>
              We select a public company and provide you with an investment
              thesis for the company.  You determine what the company is worth,
              support that valuation with data, and recommend whether we should
              buy, sell or neither.  You'll also evaluate a hypothetical private
              equity transaction to bring that same company private and complete
              a 45 minute short-answer test on finance and accounting basics.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once you begin the case you’ll have 48 hours to submit your answers.  Completing the case will take at
              least four hours of dedicated effort.
            </p>

            <h4>
              Investment Idea
            </h4>

            <p>
              You select the company.  Present your investment thesis and the
              data and investment logic to support it.  Be sure to incorporate
              background information on the company and industry, key risks, and
              return expectations.  Most of the investment ideas which are
              submitted are published on the PH Idea Forum.
            </p>

            <h4>
              PH Idea Forum
            </h4>

            <p>
              The PH Idea Forum is a place to share and discuss investment
              ideas.  Once an idea has been published, other members (candidates
              and employers) can add comments, ask questions, or provide
              feedback.  The forum can be an invaluable resource for investors
              who seek original ideas and uncommon insights.
            </p>

            <p>
              After a candidate submits their work - either an investment idea or
              the PH Case – our investment professionals will evaluate it.  If the
              reviewers' collective opinion is that it is a great write-up, the
              candidate who submitted it becomes "Certified."
            </p>

            <p>
              We evaluate each submission by asking how valuable the work would
              be to someone actively considering the investment: Is the
              conclusion valid? Is it supported by data? Does it capture the key
              drivers of the business? Are there fresh insights? Is the
              communication effective?
            </p>

            <p>
              Once someone becomes a Certified Candidate, our hedge funds and
              private equity employers will be able to actively recruit them.
            </p>

            <p>
              <em>Visit our FAQ for more info on evaluation.</em>
            </p>
        step_4:
          heading: Get Hired
          body_html: |
            <p>
              Employers use Project Hire to recruit investment professionals,
              from Analysts to Portfolio Managers.  A Certified candidate will
              be actively recruited by an elite group of hedge funds and private
              equity firms with ~$50 Billion in assets under management.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once a candidate has been Certified their profile becomes visible
              to employers. By default, each profile showcases the work the
              candidate has submitted (and our evaluation of it), plus their
              background (education, job history).  Candidates may also choose
              to include a two minute video of themselves or additional profile
              information.
            </p>

            <p>
              Employers can request an interview (or additional info) from the
              candidate, but the candidate’s name and personal info remain
              anonymous until the candidate permits the employer to view them.
              Candidates will typically interview with multiple employers before
              they accept a job offer.
